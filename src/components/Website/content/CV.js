            <h3>Lead Front-End Engineer</h3>
            <p>
              I worked at the intersection of design & development in a variety
              of environments, taught & mentored new staff, and designed the
              tools & components the rest of the team use every day. That means
              that I also worked with our clients to best understand their needs
              and how we could improve the outcome of our projects over time.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Lead Web & UI Developer</h3>
            <p>
              Build rich, smooth, useful tools from the ground up, both for
              clients and for their customers. I gradually moved from a junior
              web designer to the lead front-end developer, working principally
              on the most complex & interactive components of our projects.

            <p>
              After freelancing for a time, and spending every waking hour
              learning everything I could, I went to work with EvenVision as a
              graphic & web designer, making neat things from business cards to
              mockups in Illustrator to handling the styling & basic dev on
              websites.
