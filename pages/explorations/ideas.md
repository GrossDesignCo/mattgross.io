# Exploration Ideas

Animation units reference
- Demo what kinds of properties can be animated, whether they support sub-pixel rendering, what kinds of transitions work and what don't

Typography scaling/draw links along the different sizes/units to visually demo em/ch/lh units

Use scroll based animations to reveal a back button

Glitch effect tutorial

Procedural cityscape
- grid of rectangles, random heights
- drab purple to bright orange, do a distance shader?
- each rectangle gets some random grids of squares and lights
- sunset scene
- streaks vertically in backround to mimic spiderverse

Dynamcic headline/font-weight
- Make font-weight/size a function of viewport size
- lighter and bigger as viewport increases
- smaller and chunkier as viewport decreases
- Create it in a sub-page, render in an iframe
- Add clean/elegant resizing handles

UI Concept for a Eng-Hebrew Literal Interlinear
- Flip directions/mirror characters
- Literal 1:1

collection of sine/cosine waves being added/multiplied together
- just clean, simplistic waves animating on the screen

something like the mandala, but with an interlocking grid of hexagons (or something)
- use more stylized/contrasting colors
- render the circle of shapes into a rectangle, like a frameless framed piece
- explore gradients along just one or two colors and animation
